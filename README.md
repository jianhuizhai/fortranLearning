## This folder includes the code those I learn from book : 

* Introduction to programming with fortran

## Useful knowledges

* continuation mark is the ampersand (&) character
```
 x =  1       &
      + 2
      
 x =          &
      & 1+2
```
* array
```
a(ipoint)  !ipoint is rank-one intger array

(/ 1,2,3,5,10 /) or [1,2,3,4, 5] ==> [(i, i=1,5)]

(/ 2,4,6,8,10 /) ==> (/ (i,i=2,8,2) /)
an array constant of rank greater than one may be constructed by using the function reshape 
to reshape a rank-one array constant.
```
